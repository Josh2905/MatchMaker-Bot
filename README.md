# MatchMaker-Bot
current version: 1.2.2

I created this bot to get an intuitive non complicated solution for cluttered matchmaking channels in smash bros discord servers.

Remember to put the bot role above your 1vs1/2vs2 roles!

Main Features:
- easy to set up because of adequate default values
- all values below are customizable
- uses dedicated matchmaking channel
- A single main message will be reposted after 10 messages or after 5 minutes have passed.(old one is always deleted)
- Default content of main message is a short guide to the bot. (3 lines)
- Main message has reactions for 1vs1 and 2vs2 searches.
- Users Click on a reaction or use the command to get a 1vs1/2vs2 role.
- all users with the corresponding role will be notified as soon as a new user is searching for a match.
- Roles will be removed automatically after one hour. The notification will be removed too. (no clutter)

Additional Features(optional):
- roll command
- create custom commands that make the bot either respond in the same channel or send a direct message
